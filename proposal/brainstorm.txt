Number of threads
queue up multiple AIO for reads
keep track of pages in memory
fallocate
readahead
2 MPMC, 1 for directory 1 for file.
Prioritize directories -> Large files -> Small files
  Is it possible to queue up a bunch of inode writes first? (locality)
dynamically calibrate copy concurrency
detect hard links and only read linked files once
can we explicitly not update access time?
compare blocking/non-blocking I/O
fadvise vs mmap/madvise
compare threaded synchronous I/O vs threaded asynchronous I/O vs unthreaded asynchronous I/O
a calibratable form of threaded asynchronous I/O will be sufficient to implement all three of the above
